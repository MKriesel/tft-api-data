# tft-api-data
First Javascript project gather data from TFT using the Riot API

This is my first javascript project and it pulls match history from the Riot Api and stores the matches in a database to be used to gather various statistic on the game. It averages various stats from the game and converts the data into an xlsx spreadsheet to view and create graphs and sort through data.

Uses:
nedb
dotenv
node-fetch
xlsx
